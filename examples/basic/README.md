# Basic examples

The `basic` directory contains self-contained scripts that demonstrate fundamental SDK features.

## Highlighted scripts

- `hello_world.py`: Minimal agent that returns a greeting.
- `dynamic_system_prompt.py`: Builds an agent with runtime instructions.
- `dnp_voice_prompt.py`: Shows how to assemble instructions from `dnp/AGENTS.md` and the exemplar narrative so agents keep the DNP writing style.

Run any script with `uv run python path/to/script.py`.
