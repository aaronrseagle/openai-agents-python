## Purpose and Supporting Objectives

Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a leading driver of preventable morbidity within the primary-care population at Inspire Health and Wellness. Primary care providers manage high visit volumes, limited psychiatric access, and variable adherence to national guidelines despite clear recommendations for measurement-based and stepped-care treatment (Department of Veterans Affairs & Department of Defense, 2022; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2022; World Health Organization, 2025). Embedding a supervised artificial-intelligence (AI) psychiatric consultation step within the clinical workflow offers an opportunity to strengthen consistency in depression management and referral decision-making while maintaining full clinician oversight, patient safety, and confidentiality.

Therefore, the purpose of the proposed Doctor of Nursing Practice project is to implement and evaluate a supervised AI psychiatric consultation protocol to be utilized by primary-care providers for adult depression management. The AI tool will function as a non-autonomous, reference-based decision-support system that analyzes only de-identified, non-HIPAA-regulated clinical information entered by the provider. No patient identifiers will be shared with any AI system, and only OpenEvidence will operate within its own compliant framework. The protocol will automatically terminate and alert the provider to obtain a human psychiatric evaluation whenever red-flag criteria are detected.

### Eligibility and Safety Logic
The AI protocol will be used only for adults presenting with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Scores of 0–4 indicate minimal or no symptoms, 5–9 indicate mild depression (providers may use clinical judgment to proceed), and 10–14 indicate moderate depression and eligibility for AI consultation. Scores of 15–19 represent moderately severe depression, and 20–27 represent severe depression; both categories automatically trigger a hard-stop alert.

A hard-stop will also occur if the patient answers “yes” to PHQ-9 question 9 or has documentation of suicidal ideation, prior suicide attempt, psychiatric hospitalization, psychotic symptoms, or any known psychiatric, neurocognitive, or developmental disorder. When triggered, the AI consultation will immediately end and display a “Human Psychiatric Evaluation Required” notice. All AI outputs will include the disclaimer: “These recommendations are not medical advice and may be inaccurate. Clinicians must verify all information and consult a licensed mental-health provider before implementing any recommendation.”

The following objectives will support the purpose of the proposed DNP project:

**Model Evaluation:** Conduct a blinded comparison of four AI models and one human psychiatric provider using standardized, de-identified depression cases to identify the model demonstrating the highest clarity, safety, and guideline adherence.

**Workflow Implementation:** Train participating providers on the standardized AI psychiatric consultation process and achieve at least 90 percent fidelity to the workflow within four weeks of pilot implementation.

**AI Utilization:** Within four weeks of implementation, ensure that at least 90 percent of eligible mild-to-moderate depression encounters (PHQ-9 scores 5–14) include documented consultation with the selected AI psychiatric protocol.

**Safety and Feasibility:** Throughout the pilot, maintain zero instances of inappropriate continuation beyond red-flag thresholds (PHQ-9 ≥ 15, a “yes” response to question 9, or qualifying psychiatric history) and achieve at least 80 percent provider-rated usability and trust in the AI workflow.
