Major depressive disorder (MDD) continues to expose systemic fragility in U.S. primary care, where nurses remain central to detecting and managing a condition that drives chronic morbidity and preventable mortality (Department of Veterans Affairs & Department of Defense, 2022). Safety-net evidence shows the scale of unmet need: in one urban primary care cohort, 82% of patients screened positive for depression and 43.5% reported recent suicidality, demonstrating why measurement-based nursing protocols must be routine rather than reactive (Mladen et al., 2021). When academic health centers embedded standardized screening algorithms, clinicians identified 366 students who required immediate education, counseling, or pharmacotherapy (Salinas et al., 2024). Collaborative practice models sustain treatment gains; in a pharmacist-led case, PHQ-9 scores declined from 11 to 4 while cardiometabolic control improved, confirming that advanced practice nurses and clinical pharmacists extend psychiatric capacity when empowered to titrate therapy (Stuhec, 2025). After Medicare reduced outpatient mental health coinsurance from 50% to 20%, beneficiaries with depression completed 0.54 additional visits per year and overall utilization rose 6.6% annually, signaling that policy alignment is essential to support equitable follow-up (Tetlow et al., 2025). Regulators likewise concede that behavioral health wait-time standards remain aspirational because states cannot consistently monitor network performance amid persistent workforce shortages, leaving primary care nurses as the de facto safety net for triage, relapse prevention, and suicide surveillance (Sommers et al., 2024). A large delivery system reported that generative models drafting portal replies shortened physicians’ inbox reading time and expanded response quality, allowing clinicians to redirect attention toward complex counseling while retaining final editorial control (Tai-Seale et al., 2024). National technology leaders outline how large language models could streamline education, assessment, and intervention if organizations confront hallucinations, inequity, and privacy through multidisciplinary oversight and rigorous safety benchmarks (Lawrence et al., 2024). Systematic reviews and expert interviews emphasize that most mental health language-model studies lack validation, multilingual data, and transparent governance, warning that premature deployment could entrench bias unless clinicians remain deeply involved in design and evaluation (Buhr et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2024). Benchmark testing further reminds nursing leaders that even advanced models falter on counterfactual cases, so sustained human supervision is mandatory (Bedi et al., 2025). Collectively, these national indicators affirm that nursing-led, AI-augmented depression care must pair standardized screening, collaborative medication management, policy advocacy, and ethical technology stewardship to achieve reliable, just, and person-centered outcomes across U.S. communities.
