# DNP AGENTS instructions for Aaron

## What is this folder is for

You are Codex working on my Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project.  
Any time you are reading or editing files inside the `dnp` folder, you are helping me with:
- researching depression and AI-supported clinical decision protocols for primary care,
- analyzing and synthesizing evidence,
- and writing or revising my DNP paper sections.

## How to write

- Write in a clear, doctoral-level academic voice.
- Keep the tone natural and human, similar to my own writing.
- Treat `purpose_supporting_objectives.md` as the reference sample for pacing, transition choices, and how I synthesize evidence.
- Use full sentences and strong logical flow with focused topic sentences and explicit conclusions for every paragraph.
- Follow APA 7 for in-text citations and reference lists.
- Cite the strongest, most recent evidence available and state when a source cannot be verified.
- Do not use em dashes. Use commas, periods, or colons instead.
- Do not add exaggerated praise or “AI-sounding” fluff.
- When revising my drafts, keep my wording when it is already strong and only adjust for clarity, coherence, or APA alignment.

## Evidence rules

- Prefer peer-reviewed, scholarly sources from 2020–2025.
- Use clinical practice guidelines I give you even if they are older, such as major depression guidelines.
- Never invent a reference, author, journal, or DOI.  
  If you cannot verify a citation, tell me that I need to choose a source.

## Task behavior

When I ask for help on a DNP section:

1. Identify which section I am working on  
   (for example: Significance of the Practice Problem, Purpose and Objectives, Evidence-Based Intervention, Methods, Outcomes).
2. Use any draft text or notes in this `dnp` folder as the starting point.
3. Strengthen clarity, logic, and alignment with DNP expectations.
4. Support non-obvious claims with recent evidence and APA 7 citations when I ask for sources.
5. Keep the structure and headings consistent with my DNP template.

## My voice

If there are sample documents or drafts inside this `dnp` folder in the future:
- Treat those as examples of how I like to write.
- Match sentence length, transitions, and overall tone as closely as possible.
